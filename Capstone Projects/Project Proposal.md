### Problem 
Zillow's Economic Research Team collects, cleans and publishes housing and economic data from a variety of public and proprietary sources. Public property record data filed with local municipalities -- including deeds, property facts, parcel information and transactional histories -- forms the backbone of our data products, and is fleshed out with proprietary data derived from property listings and user behavior on Zillow. We need to predict  2017 House Prices.


### Who might care? 
Real Estate companies and agents who would be interested in determining value estimates of homes, it can also be used to predict  value changes of each home in a given time frame (such as one, five, or 10 years). It can also be used by Business owners who would be interested in setting up their business location in a new place based on the demographics of the location. On the other hand, such a predictive model would enhance the product base of real estate  companies. Moreover, there is a possibility of developing an app which users can use to know about prices of their dream home in their preferred location in advance.

### Data
Zillow metrics are reported for common US geographies including Nation, State, Metro (2013 Census Defined CBSAs), County, City, ZIP code, and Neighborhood.

Zillow region names and federally defined region names and linking variables such as County FIPS codes and CBSA codes. Cities and Neighborhoods do not match standard jurisdictional boundaries. Zillow city boundaries reflect mailing address conventions and so are often visually similar to collections of ZIP codes.

Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): A smoothed seasonally adjusted measure of the median estimated home value across a given region and housing type. A dollar denominated alternative to repeat-sales indices. Find a more detailed methodology [here](http://www.zillow.com/research/zhvi-methodology-6032/)


### Modeling approach
 Since we want to predict the house prices in 2017 , a supervised classification algorithm is a perfect choice to build the predictive model. The classification algorithm would  predict the probability of each class. This data set contains huge volume of data, which makes the project challenging. We plan to use different approaches to clean data and choose the best one. Also, we will try various classification algorithms and pick the one which performs best.
